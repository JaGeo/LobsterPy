Installation
============

1. Create a conda enviornment with any suitable name eg:- conda create
   -n Test python==3.9 (This step is optional but it is better to have
   seperate environments to avoid conflicts with other packages)
2. Activate the newly created enviornment ``conda activate Test``
3. Use ``pip install lobsterpy`` to install the package and all its
   dependencies.

Now that you have installed the lobsterpy, one can use the built-in
command-line interface of this package to adapt the standard VASP input
file (INCAR) and create lobster input files needed for successfully
performing bonding analysis.
