The image is from a talk given by Prof. Dr. George at [MC16 2023 Dublin](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-bam/frontdoor/index/index/start/0/rows/10/sortfield/year/sortorder/desc/searchtype/simple/query/George/author_facetfq/George%2C+Janine/doctypefq/lecture/docId/57876)  \n",

    "Unlike purely geometry-based algorithms, e.g., Voronoi construction, which depends on angle and distance cutoffs, LobsterEnv needs only one parameter that influences neighbor selection, i.e., ICOHPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when running automatic analysis using the Analysis module, `cutoff_icohp` is the parameter to be paid attention to. This value is set to 10% by default. This means that, depending on the type of bond (cation-anion or all), only ICOHPs with a value of more than 10% of the largest ICOHPs (this value also changes depending on the type of bonds considered for analysis, cation-anion/all bonds) are considered in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `noise_cutoff` parameter takes care of numerical noise, which always exists in theoretical computations. So, ICOHPs, which are negligible, will not be considered in the bonding analysis.\n",

    "3. Perform numerical integration of the summed COHPs at each site to evaluate the bonding and antibonding integral and percentages below efermi.\n",
    "4. One can also set the `start` parameter when initializing the Analysis class object to set the start point of energy range below efermi for the integration. (Optional and useful if one wants to look at specific energy range below efermi)\n",

    "Ideally, the $(bonding-antibonding) $ integral values should equal the summed ICOHP values at each site. However, as it is a known fact, numerical integration is bound to have some errors. Thus, we might not see this corroborate well for all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial factor influencing the results of the numerical integration is the number of points on which the integration is performed. Thus, having a finer grid, i.e., setting `COHPSteps` to `2000` or more in your LOBSTER run, will help one get better estimates. From our experience, setting `COHPSteps` to `10000` provided very consistent results. (Be mindful that the sizes of files generated from such setting can become quite large depending on the complexity of the structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to note that the ICOHP values from `ICOHPLIST.lobster` consider the entire range below efermi. Thus, if the `COHPCAR.lobster` is not computed for the entire energy range below efermi, then your results will also not corroborate to the summed ICOHPs at the site.\n",
