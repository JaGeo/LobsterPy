# Summary
_Lobsterpy_ is a Python package developed to systematically analyze,
describe, and visualize LOBSTER computations results. Alongside its python
interface, it also provides an easy-to-use command line interface (CLI) that runs automatic analysis of
the computations and generates a summary of results and publication-ready
figures. Since its first release, its capabilities have been extended significantly.
Unlike earlier versions which could only automatically analyze Crystal Orbital Hamilton
Populations (COHPs)[@dronskowski1993crystal], Lobsterpy can now also
analyze crystal orbital overlap populations (COOP)[@hughbanks1983chains] and Crystal orbital
bond index (COBI)[@muÌˆller2021crystal] to extract summarized bonding information
comprising of electronic-structure based coordination environments, bond strengths,
most relevant bonds, and their corresponding bonding and anti-bonding contributions.
Furthermore, one can now also extract the most relevant orbital interaction information.
Additionally, featurize and structure graphs modules provide a pathway to generate features to be used further for machine learning studies.
The features section comprehensively overviews the functionalities of this package.

_Lobsterpy_ was used to produce the results in [@ngo2023dft, @naik2023quantumchemical]

# Statement of need
Although the idea of "chemical bonding" might seem perplexing from a
physical standpoint, it has been employed several times to explain
various chemical phenomena and material properties.[@das2023strong, @ertural2022first,
@hu2023mechanism] With the recent
advances in automation frameworks for high-throughput computational
investigations, bonding analysis for thousands of crystalline materials
could be performed with few lines of code.[@george2022automated] This
automation helps reduce the common mistakes inexperienced users make
while performing bonding analysis. However, it is essential to systematically
generate inputs and post-process the output files consistently to have
reliable and reproducible results. Furthermore,
having data from high-throughput calculations ready to utilize as inputs
would benefit data-driven material science research. _Lobsterpy_ fulfills
this missing link.

# Features
- Automatic summarized bonding analysis JSONs and text descriptions based on COHPs, COBIs and COOPs
- JSONs and textual description of LOBSTER calculation quality
- Static and interactive plots of most relevant COHPs, COBIs and COOPs
- Generate inputs for bonding analysis calculations
- Generate features to be used for ML studies


# Availability
Lobsterpy can be found on GitHub and is also available from PyPI.
Detailed software documentation and installation instructions are provided.
The package also comes with several Jupyter Notebook and CLI tutorials
illustrating the usage and features.
